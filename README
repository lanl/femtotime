# femtotime

femtotime is a library for time tracking which uses 128 bit integers to allow
tracking time with femtosecond resolution.

## About

The `femtotime` API consists of 3 classes: `utc_time_t`, `gps_time_t`, and
`duration_t`. These classes all contain numerous methods for querying the time,
and converting timestamps between representations.

## History

The idea for this program came from something said by Keith Packard in a
conversation with Mark Galassi, and was implemented by Patrick Norton.

Approved for LANL public release: C22080.

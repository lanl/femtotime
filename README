femtotime is a library for time tracking which uses 128 bit integers
to allow tracking time with femtosecond resolution.

The API takes the form of a C++ class gps_time_t, which allows
setting, getting, manipulation, and conversion of time.  The
conversion to and from UTC tracks leapseconds.

Approved for LANL public release: C22080.
